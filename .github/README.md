# dahliaOS Wallpapers
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/dahlia-os/wallpapers?color=brightgreen)

 - Official and community-made wallpapers for dahliaOS
 - All community designs must follow the design guidelines written below
 - With designer's consent, we might pick some community wallpapers and make them dahliaOS official ones if we like them

## Design guidelines

* Every submitted wallpaper must be in both PNG/JPEG and SVG/RAW format
  * If you've submitted a photograph, you must provide raw image data instead of an SVG
  * Wallpapers should be atleast 3840x2160 pixels, not smaller than 1920x1080 pixels
* dahliaOS has two main colors, Deep Orange and Shallow Orange
  * Hex code for Deep Orange is #C00000
  * Hex code for Shallow Orange is #FF4300
* You can find dahliaOS/Pangolin logos right [here](https://github.com/dahlia-os/brand)

## Important

* **Do not** publish a wallpaper you're not an owner of
* Licensed wallpapers are not accepted
* Make sure your SVG isn't rasterized (Photoshop users will understand)
